# Kata: Library Management System

Objective : 
Create a simple library management system that allows users to perform basic operations
such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books.
Requirements
 1. Add Books:
• Users should be able to add new books to the library.
• Each book should have a unique identifier (e.g., ISBN), title, author, and
publication year.
 2. Borrow Books:
• Users should be able to borrow a book from the library.
• The system should ensure that the book is available before allowing it to be
borrowed.
• If the book is not available, the system should raise an appropriate error.
 3. Return Books:
• Users should be able to return a borrowed book.
• The system should update the availability of the book accordingly.
 4. View Available Books:
• Users should be able to view a list of all available books in the library.

Instructions

 1. Code Only:
• This is a code-only kata. Focus on writing clean, maintainable code and
implementing the required features. Do not spend time creating any user
interface.
 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD):
• Write tests before implementing the functionality. Follow the three laws of TDD
• Ensure that all tests pass before considering the implementation complete.
• Aim for high test coverage and meaningful test cases.
 3. Clean Coding Practices:
• Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
• Follow SOLID principles and other best practices in software design.
• Ensure the code is well-documented with meaningful comments and clear
variable/method names.
 4. Git Usage:
• Use Git for version control.
• Create a Git repository for your project.
• Commit your changes frequently with meaningful commit messages to show
your TDD journey.
• Push your code to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and
share the repository link.

Deliverables
. A Git repository link containing the source code for the library management system.
. A README file explaining how to set up and run the project.
. A test report showing the results of the test cases.
